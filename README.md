## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Transitions
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about styling custom form elements!

In this project I needed to create a custom toggle switch by styling a checkbox and I needed to create a custom slider component.

The components were quite involved, so I ended up separating them into their own CSS files to make the project more readable.

### Continued Development

Despite most web browsers playing well together these days (thank you web standards), I discovered that there are still huge compatibility issues when it comes to styling the range input element.

I was able to use vendor prefixes successfully for the most part (to style the track and the thumb).

However, I also wanted to change the colour of the slider to the left of the thumb as a visual indicator of the user's scrolling progress across the track.

Firefox has a simple prefix (-moz-) to implement this function, but other (-webkit-) browsers do not.

**Code snippet: -moz- prefix to display range progress**

```
input[type="range"]::-moz-range-progress {
    background:#a2f2ea;
    height:0.5rem;
    border-radius:2rem;
}
```

I personally use Firefox, so it looks great on my browser, but when I open Safari or Chrome it doesn't show up. Fortunately, this is purely aesthetic and doesn't affect the usability of the component as a whole.

There must be a way to implement this in javaScript... ðŸ¤” so in the future I'd like to add this feature.
